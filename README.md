Matlab code of solving 2D Navier stokes equation - fluid flow over a square body 

2D Navier stokes equation is solved by Jos stam stable fluid algorithm. The pressure poisson equation
is solved by direct method(matrix). And advection is solved by 4th order Runge kutta.
Von Karman Vortex Shedding is observed when the flow passes over a square body. [Laminar flow]
